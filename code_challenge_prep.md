### Objects
I never understood the last problem that said "accessory keys can be computed names too".

### Classes
I had trouble with "class can extend `null`, and is not an instance of Object"

### Destructuring
The arrays mostly made sense, except there was a question asking about how to get the last item in the array. I used commas to get to the one I wanted. Two questions later was about leading commas so I wonder if there was another way to solve it. I tried googling, but didn't come up with anything simple. There was a lot of examples using slice or otherwise writing a lot of code to get to the answer.

The last one of the object destructuring has a prototype and I don't really understand those.

The last one of the function paramers allows you to pass in the value of the id in the function, but not the value of the array and object. That seemed confusing to me.

### Rest
The rest parameter makes sense, it almost seems weird that we haven't encountered it already. There's got to be many times that you don't know how many arguments or parameters there will be and use the `...`
That being said, I don't totally understand why it's used for constructors.

### Spread
I again had trouble for the last one that asked about constructors. I need to read more about them.

### Defaults
The last one says that defaults can also be a function. I tried to make it an anonymous arrow function but it continues to come up undefined.
